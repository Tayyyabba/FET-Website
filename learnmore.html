        <h3>Welcome To Faculty of Engineering & Technology</h3>
        <p>Faculty of Engineering and Technology is composed of an Institute and six departments: Prof. A. H. S. Bukhari
          Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Department of Electronics Engineering, Department of
          Telecommunication Engineering, Department of Information Technology, Department of Software Engineering,
          Department of Telemedicine and e-Health and Department of Industrial Electronics Engineering. A. H. S Bukhari
          Institute of Information and Communication Technology is an independent post-graduate institute offering
          MS/MPhil programs in disciplines of Electronics, Telecommunications, Information Technology and Software
          Engineering, and PhD degree program in Information Technology. Currently, over 300 students are enrolled in
          all MS/ MPhil and PhD programs. Department of Electronics Engineering and Department of Telecommunication
          Engineering offers a 4-year 8-semester undergraduate program, namely BS Electronics Engineering and BS
          Telecommunication Engineering and both these programs are accredited with Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC).
          Department of Information Technology and Department of Software Engineering offers a 4-year 8-semester
          undergraduate program, BS Information Technology and BS Software Engineering respectively and both programs
          are accredited with the National Computing Education Accreditation Council (NCEAC). Both BS Information
          Technology and BS Software Engineering programs are offered in morning as well as in evening.</p>


         <p>Faculty of Engineering and Technology has an excellent infrastructure in terms of highly qualified faculty
          members (there are around as many as 20 PhD faculty members and most of them have earned their degrees from
          educationally advanced countries), well-equipped state-of-the-art laboratories catering the needs of practical
